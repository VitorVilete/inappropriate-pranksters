## Research 
### WarioWare-inspired
The variety of mechanics, modifiers, and fast-paced minigames was inspired by the game WarioWare in any of its editions. The team explored various minigames from the series to draw inspiration for challenges and progression in the desired format.

### Fishing Mini-games
In the initial gameplay concept of the game, the gameplay takes place in the UI within tension bars. Inspired by fishing minigames, we decided to bring the progress bar mechanic to simplify development and evoke the feeling of pressure and tension, which is already the objective of these bars in fishing minigames. The team's main inspiration was the mechanic from Stardew Valley.

### Graphics
The game has a 8-bit art style inspired by the simple graphics found in the mini-games from retro consoles. The team thinks that this kind of mechanics works better with 8-bit style.

### The Mini-games

- Handshake - The prankster will have to shake hands with a stranger and hold it for a certain time. The gameplay translates into the player having to keep one area close to another moving area for as long as possible. The bar is modified in three different ways along the 60 seconds of gameplay. The player wins if they can manage the areas close to another for the whole time.

- Stealth Chase - The prankster will have to closely follow a person without being noticed. The player must hold the button to make their character walk at the person's pace. At certain moments, the person will signal that they are about to stop walking. If the player touches the person or if the player gets too far away, the prankster loses. If the player manages to follow the person until the end of the time, the prankster wins.

- Interview - The prankster will have to conduct an interview with a stranger. However, the stranger is unaware that there is a TV behind them showing hilarious things for the interviewer to watch. The prankster needs to pay attention to the interviewee and not laugh, or they will lose. The player must hold the interaction button when the prankster starts to feel like laughing to prevent the laughter bar from rising. Once the laughter bar rises to the maximum, the prankster will laugh and give up on the interview, losing the game. The player wins if they can finish the interview without laughing.

The details of the design of each game including modifiers and telegraphing can be accessed in the team Figma diagram.
